      <p>"I bomb atomically, Socrates philosophies
        And hypotheses cant define how I be droppin these
        Mockeries, lyrically perform armed robbery
        Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
        Battle-scarred shogun, explosion when my pen hits
        Tremendous, ultra violet shine blind forensics
        I inspect view through the future see millennium
        Killa Beez sold fifty gold sixty platinum"</p><br>
      <p>"The new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis
        Shining, like who on top of this?
        People was hustling, arguing and bustling
        Gangsters of Gotham hardcore hustling
        I'm wrestling with words and ideas
        My ears is picky, seeking what will transmit
        The scribes can apply to transcript, yo
        This aint no time where the usual is suitable"</p><br>
      <p>"Soy el fuego que arde tu piel
        Soy el agua que mata tu sed
        El castillo, la torre, yo soy
        La espada que guarda el caudal"</p><br>
      <p>Erre con erre, guitarra;
        erre con erre, carril:
        rápido ruedan los carros,
        rápido el ferrocarril.</p><br>
      <p>"The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be
        great in whatever they want to do."</p><br>
      <p>"When I was young me and my mama had beef
        Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
        Though back at the time, I never thought Id see her face
        Ain't a woman alive that could take my mamas place
        Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
        With the big boys, breaking all the rules
        I shed tears with my baby sister"</p>
